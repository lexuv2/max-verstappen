# OpenAI Gymnasium - Mountain Car

The goal of the Mountain Car problem is to develop an agent that can learn to drive a car up a steep hill. The car is underpowered and cannot drive directly up the hill. Instead, the car must learn to drive back and forth to build up enough momentum to reach the goal.

This repository contains the code for the Mountain Car problem in the OpenAI Gymnasium.
